# PHPDoc Markdown Documentor
A template for writing documentation using phpDoc. Writes documentation for all Public apis and global functions.

## Why
I could only find a documentator for public APIs but I wanted something that would document all declared functions as well.

## Got Issues?
Write me a note or log an issue in github.

## Testing
Run phpdoc from the `./test/` directory and see if the output is satisfactory to you
